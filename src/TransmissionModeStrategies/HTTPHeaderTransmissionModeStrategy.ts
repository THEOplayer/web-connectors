/**
 * The transmission mode strategy to transmit CMCD data as HTTP Headers as specified in section 2.1 of CTA-5004.
 * This strategy will add CMCD headers prefixed with `CMCD-` based on their expected level of variability:
 * - CMCD-Request: keys whose values vary with each request.
 * - CMCD-Object: keys whose values vary with the object being requested.
 * - CMCD-Status: keys whose values do not vary with every request or object.
 * - CMCD-Session: keys whose values are expected to be invariant over the life of the session.
 * Note the addition of these headers will trigger CORS pre-flight requests in most web based environments.
