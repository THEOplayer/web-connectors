# comscore-connector-web

The Comscore connector provides a Comscore integration for THEOplayer.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @theoplayer/comscore-connector-web
```

This connector depends on the JavaScript ComScore SDK, which should be loaded and available in the global scope before the connector. Get it from your ComScore dashboard or talk to a ComScore representative. This connector was developed and tested with versions 7.2.0.200214 and 7.6.1.210506

```html
<script src="/path/to/comscore.js">
```

## Usage

### Configuring the connector

Create the connector by providing the `THEOplayer` instance, a ComscoreConfiguration (which contains your publisher id, also referred to as the c2 value) and the ComscoreMetadata of the first source being set to the player. You can change the metadata dynamically throughout the lifecycle of the connector.

```js
import { ComscoreConnector } from '../../dist/comscore-connector.esm.js';

const comscoreConfig = {
    publisherId: '<your publisher id>',
    applicationName: 'Test App',
    userConsent: '1',
    debug: true
};

const comscoreMetadata = {
    mediaType: 'longFormOnDemand',
    uniqueId: 'testuniqueId',
    length: 634566, // in milliseconds
    stationTitle: 'THEOTV',
    programTitle: 'Big Buck Bunny',
    episodeTitle: 'Intro',
    genreName: 'Animation',
    classifyAsAudioStream: false,
    customLabels: {
        testcustomlabel: 'testcustomvalue'
    }
};

const comscoreConnector = new ComscoreConnector(player, comscoreConfig, comscoreMetadata);
```

### Passing metadata dynamically

The connector allows updating the current asset's metadata at any time. Do it when setting a new source to the player.

```js
comscoreConnector.updateMetadata(newMetadata);
```

### ComscoreMetadata fields

Based on the `ComscoreMetadata` type, you can tell which fields are mandatory and which aren't. Note that this is purely for the integration to work correctly. Depending on the Comscore solution you are using, different fields are required/optional. The mandatory fields in the `ComscoreMetadata` type are the ones that are mandatory for all three Comscore solutions:

-   Video Metrix (V)
-   Cross Platform Product Suite (X)
-   Cross Media Audience Measurement (C)
